# First Full TypeScript Project

## Completed February 2024
## This was my first full project written entirely in TypeScript, completed while following the WebDevSimplified TypeScript course. It helped me get comfortable with strong typing, interfaces, and modern TypeScript best practices.

- Focused on building a scalable, type-safe frontend application
- Improved understanding of types, generics, and strict compiler options
- Hands-on experience integrating TypeScript with DOM manipulation and event handling
